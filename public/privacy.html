Privacy Policy for Morpho App
Last Updated: January 29, 2026

At Morpho Cafe ("we," "us," or "our"), we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the Morpho App (the "Service") to order food and beverages.

By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information We Collect
We collect only the information necessary to process your orders and provide a seamless dining experience.

A. Personal Information
When you register or place an order, we may ask for:

Name: To identify your order.

Phone Number: To contact you regarding order status or delivery updates.

Email Address: Used for account authentication (Google Sign-In) and account recovery.

Delivery Address: Exact location and landmarks to ensure successful delivery.

Profile Picture: (Optional) To personalize your experience.

B. Security Information
PIN: A 4-digit security PIN used to secure your account access.

Security Question & Answer: Used strictly for resetting your PIN if you forget it.

C. Usage Data
Order History: We store details of your past orders to allow for easy re-ordering and order tracking.

Local Storage: We use your device's local storage to save your shopping cart items and login session so you don't have to log in every time.

2. How We Use Your Information
We use your data for the following purposes:

Order Processing: To prepare, cook, and package the correct items.

Delivery Services: To guide our riders to your exact location (using the address and coordinates you provide).

Communication: To send you real-time updates (e.g., "Order Accepted," "Rider on the Way").

Account Management: To allow you to log in, view history, and manage your favorites.

Improvement: To analyze popular items and improve our menu offerings.

3. How We Store and Share Data
A. Data Storage
Your data is securely stored using Google Firebase, a world-class cloud infrastructure provider. We utilize:

Firebase Authentication: To securely manage user logins.

Firestore Database: To store user profiles and order records.

B. Data Sharing
We do not sell your personal data. We only share information with:

Our Staff: Kitchen staff (to prepare food) and Riders (to deliver food). Riders only see your address and phone number while the delivery is active.

Service Providers: We use trusted third-party services like Google Maps (for location pinning) and Google Cloud (for hosting the app).

4. Account Deletion
You have the right to delete your account at any time.

Go to your Profile inside the app.

Scroll down and tap "Delete My Account".

Enter your PIN to confirm.

Once requested, your account will be scheduled for permanent deletion within 5 days. All your personal data (Name, Phone, Email, Address) will be removed from our active database.

5. Security of Your Data
We take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect your data.

All data transmission is encrypted via SSL/TLS (HTTPS).

Sensitive actions (like account deletion) require PIN verification.

We do not store credit card details directly; payment methods (Cash, GCash, Maya) are recorded only as selected options.

6. Children's Privacy
Our Service is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
